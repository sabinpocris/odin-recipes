	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>
	    Wiener schnitzel is a type of schnitzel made of a thin, breaded,
	    pan-fried veal cutlet.
	</p>

	<p>
	    It is one of the best known specialities of Viennese cuisine, and
	    one of the national dishes of Austria.[1][2][3]
	</p>

	
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
	    <li>4 (5-ounce) veal cutlets (or chicken or pork cutlets)</li>
	    <li>1/4 cup all-purpose (or brown rice flour)</li>
	    <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
	    <li>2 large eggs, well beaten</li>
	    <li>1/2 cup breadcrumbs</li>
	    <li>Oil or lard, for frying</li>
	    <li>4 slices lemon, garnish</li>
	</ul>

	
	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
	    <li>
		Place veal cutlets between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a
		solid, level surface. Firmly pound cutlets with the smooth
		side of a meat mallet to a 1/4-inch thickness. Dip cutlets
		in flour to coat; shake off excess.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		Beat together eggs, Parmesan cheese, milk, parsley, salt,
		pepper, and nutmeg in a shallow bowl until combined. Place
		bread crumbs on a plate. Dip each cutlet into the egg
		mixture, then press in bread crumbs to coat. Place coated
		cutlets on a plate and refrigerate for 1 hour to overnight.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook
		breaded cutlets in butter until browned, about 3 minutes
		per side. Transfer cutlets to a serving platter and pour
		pan juices over them. Garnish with lemon slices.
